                  Personal Music Library Database for MS DOS Dbase III+
                   -----------------------------------------------------

Going back to the mid 1980's when MS DOS Database software (e.g. DBASE III+) was popular.
The 1985 version of Dbase III+ (V1.0) included with this software is copyrighted by
Ashton-Tate.

This simple Dbase III+ application (music.prg v3.1), after finding how relatively easy it was
to code, was created and has been recently checked for any bugs.

All checks OK, but I cannot guarantee this. Being a free software application for Dbase III+
(for personal use) it is provided as is without any warranties.

This database software has been tested on systems: 8 bit (MS DOS 3.3), 16 bit (MS DOS 6.2),
Windows 2000 (32 bit), Windows XP (32 bit) with shortcut properties to the application setup
correctly. There is a batch file (winstart.bat) included with this software that may help
users using 32 bit Windows Vista, 7 or 8.1.

Users with 64 bit operating systems or Windows 10 & above will probably need to install an
MS DOS emulator (e.g. WINEVDM or DOSBOX), mounting the folder with the database files & 
programs as a virtual drive. Shortcut properties created to the application with the command 
DBASE MUSIC can usually be modified (e.g. font and screen size) to suit your requirements.

If you want to use the Drive A: floppy disk option to reset the program, instead of the 
admin passsword (currently MUDBRS as displayed in the reset.prg module), then you should
make a (recommended) copy of the original unzipped software to the floppy Drive indentified
as Drive A: on your device. All files including the subdirectories (CODE & MUSIC) need to 
be copied to your Drive A: floppy disk that has capacity greater than 1.2 Mb.
